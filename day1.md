[Implementation of UC Berkeley's Data8 Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyUP5mMA44g)

Please watch the video in the link above. It will help to explain why this course is useful and how data science is a unique blend of 
computer science, data analytics, and real world knowledge. Data science has become applicable in many different fields and we
want to explore why and how they are connected.

There are many other videos which explore data science on the [UC Berkeley Division of Computing Data Science and Society](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYosMoD6e3_RLZyFmMXB30w/videos)
Instead of just watching the video, please practice using the tools and applications described in the videos. Write down what the tools
are used for in a blog post, and screenshot an application that you create using the tool. 

After working with one student and reviewing the day one content, here are my take-aways from that day.

1. Understanding what GitHub is and how it can be useful is challenging and confusing. When thinking about structuring a data science project
where do you store your information and how can you access that information in the future? What is the difference between a repository and a GitHub page?
Which part of Github hold the code, tha data, and the actual blogging?

2. What are GitHub pages used for?

3. Why isn't my project description specific enough? How do I define the question I am looking to answer?
Your project description was not specific enough. 
I understand that you are working with NBA data and you want to understand how individual players get better. 
In order to create a data science project around this topic, you need to be a bit more specific about the time period and your definition of improvement. 
After talking through your problem statement we looked at a dataset containing season averages and found three columns which when significantly high would indicate the player had the 'best' season. 
You need to explain why these fields indicate that the season is the best, and what the fields are tracking. 
You then explained that finding complementary data to that season could help explain why the season was so good. (additional players, improved practice regimen, etc?) You need to find a dataset and match that dataset to the player for that year. 
How would you do that? This is something to think through and explain in your first blog post.

4. How can I ensure that the data I have will help answer my questions?
You need to contextualize your dataset.

A few take-aways from today -
- Github Pages are a unique feature which we need to demonstrate provide specific value
- Project description - this needs to be data-driven. It is useful for the student to describe the project to another student so that the listening student can pick holes in the project description. When a student talks through the project out loud it becomes clear which parts are unclear. This could be a daily zoom exercise. Students seem to have a general understanding of available datasets and think that all of the relevant data would be useful for the project even though only a small subset of the data is.
- Exploring CVS files and looking at what the columns mean will have a significant impact.

Skills Acquired
- Create a technical blog
- Designing a Data Science project
- Sourcing credible datasets

MetaData to Collect
- User Account - Portfolio Link
- Skills Model - Add these skills One by One, this is a cool feature I think I will prototype
