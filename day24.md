# what is an algorithm?

As an emerging technical developer data scientist with a github account and a new fancy blog you have probabaly heard the word algorithm thrown around and you might feel intimidated by the word.
Guess what and algorithm is just a set of instructions. Seriously - its nothing more than that. The most important part of the algorithm is the end point or what you hope to get out of 
running a process or the answer you are looking for. The algorithm is the process that explains how to get there and the steps to take.

Lets give an example I think it might help us explain this topic in a bit more depth. 

> How do I send a text message to Matt?

If we are creating an algorithm to do this we need to explain every step and ensure that we explain dependent concepts as well.

1. Pick up our phone
2. Unlock the phone
3. Open the messaing application
4. Select the contact Matt
5. Draft a new message to Matt
6. Send the message
7. Ensure the message was delivered 

We did it, algorithm **DONE** HOLD UP--

- What is a phone?
- How do you unlock the phone?
- What is a messaging application and how do I open it?
- What is a contact and how do I select one?
- How do I draft a new message?
- How do I send a message?
- What does it look like when the message is delivered?

This is a learning exercise for you. Go back through each one of those steps and make sure that all of these things are defined. If there are icons that you should use how do those icons look?
If there are buttons that should exist and that you should click how do you click them? What is a phone, do smart phones work the same way flip phones work in this instance?
