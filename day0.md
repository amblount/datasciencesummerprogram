So excited for you to join the summer program. 
After you submitted your application did you receive any sort of confirmation email or notification? Did the application inform you what your next steps are or that there is a career development portion of the internship, a skill development portion and a project component of the program?

Here are your next steps:

- Create a profile on the bloc platform, Amina will send you a link that you will use to create a login to the site. 
- Create a resume on the website, as we work through the internship the big idea is to track your skill acquisition by updating your profile and resume
- Create a Github Account 
- Create a Github Page with your account - you will use this to blog daily about the progress you are making on your project
- Take the version of the resume you created on the Bloc website and move it to the about section of the Github Page - Example - Markdown Cheatsheet
- For your first post create the outline for your project, and find a dataset (1-CSV spreadsheet) - Include
  - What is the question you are trying to ask with the project? Ex: I would like to understand all of the legislation or lack thereof historically that have prevented Black Americans from exercising full citizenship
  - Think through what data would help you answer this question and examine what columns exist and ensure that your data matches a reasonable answer to your question, for instance: In the prior example I would look for a data set with columns of the names of legislation, year passed, significance (right to vote, school integration). Most likely one data set will not contain every column that you need and you will need to combine data for the information to make sense.
  - I realize that this list is not all-encompassing and you probably have many questions about the process, so please send those questions my way. If you have any questions at all using certain tools or setting up your GitHub page, please share those questions here so that I am sure to send over a full explanation to you. If there is some part of this process that does not make sense to you there are certainly going to students to whom this process is confusing as well. 

Good Luck - and I will be responsive through the weekend so please don't hesitate to send over your questions.
