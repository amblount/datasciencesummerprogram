What is Github and why are we using Github Pages to host the blog for our projects?

Github is a collaboration tool that enables developers to share code. Before github it was difficult for developers to track changes
to a codebase. With GitHub a single developer can create a repository and place all of the code related to a project in that repository and
control the permissions of that repository - so who has access to the code. Every person who has access to the repository is able
to download the code in it's current state and update the codebase. For instance if you are building a website which functions as
an ecommerce website where users can buy shoes. You might want to update the database schema relationships to enable users to create multiple carts.
If you download the repo to your local machine you can add the code to enable this functionality. Once you are happy with the changes you
made to the repository you can commit those changes. Commiting changes to the codebase would change the state of the codebase and enable
all users who have access to it to develop on top of those current changes. To ensure that no changes to the codebase are added without
a set of checks and balances GitHub creates pull requests which alert all of the project owners that there is a set of changes that
should be added to the codebase. The owner of the project inspects those changes in a process known as a code review and if the changes
make sense, they are added to the codebase.

Once new code is added to the codebase all of the developers working on the codebase need the updated version of the codebase. Your local machine has
version control software [git](https://git-scm.com/) which makes it easy to track changes to projects with state and comments. Before a user can push
new commits to the repository they need to be sure that they have the most up to date version of the repository on their local machine. They can obtain this version
by 'pulling' new changes from the master branch of the repo down to their local copy.

GitHub has a lot of functionality and initially it can be very confusing to understand and this is why you should play around with the site. 
Github is a large open-source project database. Many individuals and organizations share code and starter projects on the website
enabling anyone to 'fork' or make a copy of a project and begin to add to it or reuse that code in another way. You should browse the website
and check out the content that lives in it now. Many developers have created awesome lists that aggregate information on particular topics, if you search 
awesome [insert blank] list you will find a few interesting lists. 

Once you create your GitHub account make sure that you know how to:
- Navigate to your profile
- Understand what your GitHub username is 
- Understand what a repository is and how to find all of your repositories
- Understand how to create a new repository
- Understand what it means to clone a repository
- Understand what it means to form a repository
- Understand what markdown language is
- Understand what the terminal is
- Understand what command line tools are
- Understand how to navigate the command line

Here are a few resouces I would highly recommend you check out

Once you have created a GitHub Account Please watch this video and browse a few of the videos on the page. You might want to bookmark this tab given you will likely come back to this tab many times in the future. When you have questions about how to use the tool, the github guides are a useful resource which can help you. If you are unable to find an answer to your question in the guide please reach out to the customer support team at GitHub, the contact information is on the bottom of the site.

To add code to your repo you need to understand how to work with the command line, you need to understand what the file naviagtion system is, and have a general understanding of the operating system of your computer.

Data Science is an active process so you need to actually work through the examples to understand them for yourself. Make sure you 
open up your terminal and create a github repository and try to run all of the commands. Going through the process of writing out the
commands will make it so that your hands and your brain start to connect the new information you are trying to process.
