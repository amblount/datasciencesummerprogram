## Working with support
Yesterday we learned geneally how to use the information we have to find new information that will help us solve new problems. This is an incredibly useful skill to 
have. If we are working on solving a problem and we are able to articulate the problem we are struggling with and we can articulate the ideal solution at a high level
we should be able to query a search engine for a set of possible solutions. Once we read over a few of the proposed solutions hopefully we can gain a more well rounded understanding
of the nature of our problem and we can work with the support staff to get closer to a solution.

If we are working with a specific piece of technology or an API and we consult the technical documentation for support and are still unable to find the solution we need
to solve our problem we can contact the technical support team to help us further. Reaching out to the technical support team starts a process known as creating a support ticket.
The support ticket is used to pair the end user with a team member who will take the time to understand the problem the user is facing and try to help guide the user towards
a functional solution. 

## Organizing a data science project
Many students approach data science projects with an idea that all of the data in the world is available and could potentially be used in one data science project. If you sit with
this thought process for a moment it doesn't make sense but for some reason many students feel this way. I think that this thought process stems from how foreign actual data sets are from
end users. It is important to start a data science project with a particular data set in mind. Data science is nothing more than using data to infer something about the world, 
if there is no data colleted about a certain subject than clearly there can not be a data science project. As you think about structuring your data science project here are a few things to think about:

- What data is available?
- What does that data look like?
- How assumptions can we make about that data?
- How additional data might be useful to validate our assumptions?
- How can we turn our assumptions into a model?
