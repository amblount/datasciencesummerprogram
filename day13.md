# Computer Science Fundamentals

+ memory
+ data types
+ servers and remote storage
+ databases
+ algorithms

These concepts will come up in data science and you might not need an in depth understanding of these concepts you do need a general understanding of how what they are and how these
concepts play into your work. After working with one student on the data science project it became so clear why we need to explore these concepts in some depth, especially if the student is completely unfamiliar with these topics.

+ [Udacity](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs101) offers a free introcution to computer science course that presumes no familiarity with computer science. 
+ [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/makecode) offers a lot of different resources for student beginners. These seem to be low code options that introduce lower level themes in computer science that help high school or middle school students gain a basic understanding of what computer science is. This may be really helpful for newbies to work through given some of the themes will stick and enable you to work through more challenging subject matter at a later time.
+ [Micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) 
+ [Grow with Google](https://edu.google.com/code-with-google/?modal_active=none&story-card_activeEl=enhance-any-subject#explore-all) offers computer science courses at every level that you can work through on your own.
+ [Coursera - Python for everyone](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) The coursera catalog is full of useful computer science resources and should certainly work through one of the courses if you have the time.

I am certain there are awesome lists out there and many blogs that you can use to find coursework available to cover computer science fundamentals. The problem is no longer access to information. The real problem for many students it seems is information overload and the inability to contextualize the information that is available. It is important that you go back to your study skills and reinforce the concepts that you are learning through writing and note taking. This will really help you understand the information being presented to you. Learning actively is the most challenging portion of the learning process and once you do the hard work of making some effort over time new concepts will be more easily understood. 

Try using some of the accessibility tools like Microsoft Edge's read aloud function that will read the contents of a page to you and you can take notes on the content being presented while you listen to the audio. This might help you digest the information more clearly and help you pick up on information that would otherwise be lost.

We presented Barbara Oakley's learning how to learn course a while ago, but I will bring that course back now. Review the content presented in that course and try some of the techniques presented like, the pomodoro technique or getting a good night sleep to help you.
