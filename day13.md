# Computer Science Fundamentals

+ memory
+ data types
+ servers and remote storage
+ databases
+ algorithms

These concepts will come up in data science and you might not need an in depth understanding of these concepts you do need a general understanding of how what they are and how these
concepts play into your work. After working with one student on the data science project it became so clear why we need to explore these concepts in some depth, especially if the student is
completely unfamiliar with these topics.
