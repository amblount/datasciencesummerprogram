# Data Science Summer Program

This is the repository of blog posts explaining learning from each day of curriculum for the data science course pathway in the virtual internship program. 
We have a formal curriculum that we are following using the introduction to data science course from Microsoft Learn, but there is a lot of nuance that we encounter 
while trying to work through the material and create a project from that material. We hope to explain some of that nuance in our series of blog posts.

If you are a student working through this curriculum and some of the material presented doesn't make any sense, please comment , send and email or ask a questions so that we can work on making our documentation better.
