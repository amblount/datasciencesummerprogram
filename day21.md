# Conferences - The Secret to Understanding AI

This past week the International Conference on Machine Learning [ICML]() happened virtually and it was full of useful information for data scientists. You might be thinking - 

> "I'm a new in the realm of data science and so this conferenece is not for me."

Well newbie, guess what? You are wrong! You are SO wrong. I would highly encourage you to attend conferences like ICML and ICLR so that you can start to grow in your field. These
conferences are notable spaces where researchers share novel ideas and companies share new techniques they are working on. You might not be familiar with the most up to date modeling techniques,
and that is ok. you don't need to be right now, but by exploring conferences and reading research papers you will become more and more aware of what is going on in the field.

If you are not aware by now, I study meta-learning and I follow researchers focused on open-endedness and neuroevolutionary algorithms. It is a space concerned with building algorithms able 
to provide solution to somewhat defined problems and generate increasingly harder problems and find solutions to those as well. This technique is interesting because it outlines more
reasonable than anything I am familiar with a path towards artificial general intelligence and is not a piecemeal solution. I am interested in building intelligent systems overall
that model in a way the intelligence of humans not just mimic one aspect of the human experience like vision or language. I want to put all of the component together. After registering for 
ICML this year I looked to some of the reseachers in the metalearning space who posted about their papers or talks they were giving at the conference.

> "Wait, I'm broke - I can't afford to pay for the conference registration fee!"

Remember we are working in the field of computer science and more than likely there is someone somewhere who has encountered your problem before and foudna solution, what is the point of reinventing the wheel?
Lets search for shcolarships to the conference - Turns out on the ICML 2020 homepage there is a space for diversity and inclusion and a fellowship option. After exploring the page it is clear
that if I apply for the fellowship I get free registration to the conference!

Ok - now that I have a registration ticket, I need to plan my schedule. I am running an entire data science online program but I can manage to attend some of the workshops during the week of programming.
I need to explore the conference paage and the workshops to get an idea of what is being offered each day and how that realtes to my current interests or project. So far in the NBA analytics project
the data scientists we spoke to recommended exploring:

- unsupervised learning techniques
- computer vision
- natural lanaguage understanding / natural language processing

We haven't really gone into depth on these topics but lets see if we can query these topics to pull up a workshop - I searched for papers and then listed all of the filters and here is what I found:

### Workshops and AI Researchers

In the past most of the notable research in the field of AI was done in research groups at Universities throughout the US, but everything has changed. Technology companies are powering every aspect of modern day society and they have the money to fund big research problems and are invested in solving these problems because the solutions to these problems will increase the productivity of these companies. Universities don't have as much on the line so if they solve bis problems in AI they need to sell the solution to a large company anyhow to generate a profit. 

The researchers who once worked in large universities to get their work done now work in the research arm of technology companies and they present their work at conferences like ICML. If you checkout the workshops for these conferences you will major researchers in each of the workshop areas present their greatest challenges and highlight the culmination of their work thus far. As I have been getting up to speed with Meta-learning and researchers in this space, I noticed many of the new techniques and algorithms being presented at the conferences build off of prior work. It is useful to understand the algorithms from prior work so that the improvements make sense. Currently this might sounds like a round-about way of getting to ** go read the prior research of the presenting researchers to understand their new methods ** but this is the point.

I attended the wokshop on [continual learning](https://sites.google.com/view/cl-icml/) and there were some presented who were new to me and I followed these researchers on twitter, this is a great idea if you want to get involved with conversations around how to use the techniques presented during the workshop or in the presented paper.
