# Introduction to cloud computing

This is more like a reintroduction because you have already been working in the cloud, you just didnt realize that it was happening. You have been working with Jupyter notebooks so far and
those notebooks are hosted by Google and are running on Google servers. All of the computer power you have access to from google is not running on your your local machine. The big 
idea behind cloud compute is using computer resources that are not your own, but are owned by someone else or rather some other company.

There are a few major players in the cloud computing space and they are spending a tremedous amount of company resources investing in the cloud in general.
