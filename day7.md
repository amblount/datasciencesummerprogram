# Terminal + The command line

If you did not manage to work through the linux and command line course mentioned in week 1, it is critical that you work through this course now. If you were able to get through deploying your blog without really understanding the command you were running in the terminal you might run into problems as you continue with your data science journey given the need for you to use these commands to explore files on your computer. I am assuming that you are working with a Macbook laptop and are using the terminal to navigate the command line. 

Udacity offers a free course [Linux and the command line](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud595) which takes about 5 hours to complete. The course covers:

1. Getting into the shell - learn how to enter commands in the shell and interpret their output
2. Shell commands - explore common shell commands, and more importantly, learn how to use the Unix manual to learn more
3. The Linux Filesystem - learn how the linux filesystem is organized. Navigate directories and organize files from shell commands.

Remember - everything will not make sense immidiately. Some commands might be confusing and this is a normal part of the learning process it happens like this for everyone. To give yourself the best opportunity to learn type in the commands, once- twice- maybe even three times. After typing in the commands in the virtual terminal prompt on the Udacity platform open your own terminal and type in the commands there. Play around with the filesystem on your computer and make sure that everything makes sense. Even if it does not today, come back tomorrow and try it again. Sometimes working through the same material 2 or 3 times will ensure that the lessons stick.
