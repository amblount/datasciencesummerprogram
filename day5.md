# What's the point?

We are at the end of week one, you did it! You might not actually have a working blog and that is ok. You may only have a GitHub account and a bunch of links to other pages around the internet that you don't understand link to something else. That is ok as well. We will begin to make sense of all of this information in the near future but it is important for you to start thinking now about what we have done and why?

Hopefully by now you have taken a look at some of the learning how to learn material and you realize that learning doesn't really happen over night. When you are introduced to new information for the first time most likely it will not make any sense. You need to take the time to contextualize that information to make it make sense to you given what YOU know and given what YOU understand. Here are some useful tricks that might help you along this path:

- Read the instructions once in your head
- Re-read the instructions aloud
- Write down what is being asked of you in your own words
- If you are reading documentaion about something unfamiliar jst to understand how it works, write down terms that you do not understand 

This week our goal was to successfully create a github page and as it turns out there is documentaion that exists which walk you through creating a GitHub Page, this information is laid out as a course. [Check it out](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages). Click through the pages before you read any of the material and look at the images on the page. Even before you read about how to actually create the page take time to explore what currently exists. You will have questions and this is a good thing, make sure that you think about what those questions are and preceisly what doesn't make sense to you. Write down your questions.

As I browse through the first page of the course I notice a requirement for taking the course is completion of another course, the introduction to GitHub course. If you don't currently understand how GitHub works then taking that course is a requirement and you should take the time to work through that course first. 

#### What if after exploring the documentation I'm still stuck?
This is a real problem for many developers and one way to handle this hurdle is contact customer support. Start-ups love providing customer support because it is a great way to improve their product. More well established companies have customer support to help new users understand all of the available features and how those features work. I've noticed that new developers for some reason do not feel comfortable asking for support even when they are clearly stuck. The problem tend to lie in not understand the question they would like to solve. If you are unable to articulate the question you have then how can anyone else help you solve that problem or answer the question. Communication skills are important for developers and data scientists because they help us share with the rest of the world why we are building what we are building.

Please look back at the requirements from this week and make sure that you have a blog template up and running before Monday. You might need to dedicate a few hours to building this over the weekend, so make sure that you do this. It will be difficult the first time and you might have questions but it is important that you communicate your questions to your program managers and or to your peers. They are working on the same project that you are working on and they might have worked through the exact problem you are facing. If you are able to communicate your issue to them you might be able to search for your problem on the internet.
