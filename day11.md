# Week 3 Day 1 - Monday

#### Why doesn't it all make sense yet?

There is a lot of information. I repeat - a LOT of information. So far we have introduced the shell and all of the commands you need to
run programs and access files. We learned a bit about navigating the file structure and opening files. We ventured briefly into cloud computing 
and spinning up an EC2 instance. It feels like there are an infifnite number of tools and services that you have being thrown at you and ther
needs to be some way to keep track of it all. I am writing this to reinforce the fact that I hear you and I understand. When I first started working on a data
science project I didn't know where to start, everything felt overwhelming and confusing. I was also unfamiliar with data science tools and 
statistics. If anyone started from the bottom, it was me. Keep going, keep googling, continue taking notes. You are making progress even though
it feels like you are not.

#### It is your responsibility to contextualize

I continue to repeat this to my students -

> If it doesn't make sense to you go back to the point in time where it did make sense to you and build from there

Some part of the curriculum from our first two weeks made sense and start there. Write down what you understand and if you have questions write those down
as well. Make sure that you take the time to write through your understanding. This seems trivial but this is the learning process. It might not look like
taking well crafted notes, it might look like drawing pictures of the information that you have and making connections from there. Where ever you are starting take the time to explore your understanding of that point in time.

#### The blog

The blog at this point should be up and running. Hopefully you have reached out to GitHub support enough to work your way through any hurdles you
were facing. The documentation on the website is very thorough and if you take the time to re-read it I'm certain your question will be answered.

#### Datacamp

I really like the data camp platform as a tool to interactively learn data science. I am familiar with some of the political trouble the company has 
been in over the past few years but I have yet to find another tool that compares in quality to the resources presented on the platform. If you do 
not currently have a subscription to the platform I would encourage you to sign up and work through the first few courses in the data science with python track
You should become familiar with importing python packages and running methods that come from packages. It will feel a bit strange at first working this way
and it might even be confusing to understand why you need a package in the first place. In data science we use packages because we care about insights from
data. We are looking for answers to our questions from data and we don't need to reinvent the wheel. Some other data scientist or computer scientist
has already solved the data munging problem that you are facing and there is no reason for you to go through all of the pain of re-writing something that already exists.

#### The power of search

I found my way into metalearning by trying to build a personalized learning system to help with reading comprehension. It was really hard and I found
that for kindergarten students one of the biggest learning challenges is asking questions. Kindergarten students have so many questions and they don't
yet have the vocabulary to talk their way through the problems they are facing so there are moments when they are stuck. They might try to tactically understan 
how something in the real world works but do not have the communication tools to talk their way through the physics of the event. Even as young adults we face the same dillemma.
We might be trying to publish our GitHub page to host our blog site and somethings doesn't work in the way that the documentation describes!
** OH SNAP **
Everything is broken and the world is going to stop, I need a way to move through this problem what do I do? 

Dear Student,

I too have faced this problem. Everything is broken and my code is running the way it should run. The documentation looks like it is in French
and I can not seem to make sense of the world around me. In moments like these it is critical for you to think about the fact that you know something and development works in sequence.
Most likely ** junior data scientist ** you broke something or skipped a step a while ago and you did not realize it. 

- Don't take short cuts! Do the work and get to the understanding. If you run a commend and you do not get the desired outcome or the outcome doesn't make
any sense it is YOUR responsibility to google the error message. Copy and paste the error message into a search box and read some of the stack overflow responses. 

- Retrace your steps - what is the last command that worked? What was the command trying to accomplish? If that command didn't work either and you
tried to move on before you had a good understanding of the first command, well this is part of your problem. Make it make sense to you. Ask you self, 

> "Self, why am I doing this? What is the point?" 

If you don't have an answer and you don't know that is a problem. ** CAUTION ** do not move on. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200.
Read and re-read until you understand why you are doing what you are doing. Be militant about your data science. That is if you want to enter
the master data scientist realm. Only a few will make it through, all the others are ineffective on their data science teams. They are the people with
math skills but no product knowledge. They are NOT data scientists. They are mathematicians and we are creating data scientists.

Hmm... I think I will work back around to writing about mastering search but not at right at this moment. I need to come up with concrete examples.
