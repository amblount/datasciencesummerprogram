# From idea to product

This is a project based data science course and everyday that you learn something new you should think back to how you can use that insight to improve your data science project. You have an end goal
you are not just learning these tools and techniques for the sake of learning them, we want to apply these concepts to the real world! More specifically we want to apply this information to
our product and this is important. So far I have been doing the leg work and using exampkes from the student prject that I am monitoring but I realize I might be doing a bit too much hand holding.
Students, it is time for you to take the reigns of your own projects and venture out into creating your own models and thinking through how to use these techniques for yourself. This might sound
a little scary but I will stil be here to guide you on your journey AND I will use a real world example. Teaching this course to one student and working 1:1 with that student every day has 
allowed me to get personalized feedback into the learning process for a new data scientist. I am a lot more clear about what information makes sense right away and what needs to be 
explained a bit more. I am using all of the metadata I got from this user testing to improve an actual product that I am building for an actual platform with real users.

The company that I am currently working with created a summer virtual internship application and sent it out to a few organizations and in 2 weeks we received over 5000 applications from students.
2000 of those students indicated they would be interested in learning data science! Exciting right, I know. There is no way that I, as one person can support 2000 students and give them each 1 hour a day
but I am able to create learning tools around the material and make it so that all of the students can benefit from the learning tools that I build. Instead of working through the NBA
analytics examples with you here I am instead going to explain my thought process for my metalearning personalized learning platform experience. There are a lot of grant applications
that I am working on with this project anyway and it seems like a wonderful way to work on my research and help you learn data science all at the same time. 
Hopefully you see where I was going when I mentioned from idea to product - the data science way.

### The question
> With a day by day data science curriculum how can I create interactive learning tools that would help students understand the information that I am sharing with them?

One of my new favorite researchers Emma Brunskil shared her findings with personalized learning systems a few months ago and it seems that of all the students who register for a course only
20% of those students end up completing the course. Feel free to explore the [twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1272705226512969728.html) explaning the results of the entire case study.

I attended the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) this year for the first time and during one of the paper presentations I asked the presenter if he recommended I read any papers that might be relevant to my work. I explained to him that I was working on building a better recommendation system to help students learn how to read and he recommended I check out Emma Brunskill's work. I explored her academic website and found a lot of interesting papers, but I did not have the time at that point to take a deep dive into the field. When I think back to where I was in terms of my project it was not well defined in general. There are many researchers working on creating intelligent learning systems and it doesn't make any sense to build totally from scratch. 

Planning to come back to this **draft**
