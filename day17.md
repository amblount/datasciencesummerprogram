# Exploratory Data Analysis + Visualizing Data

We have been working with tabular data so far and this has been useful. We have been able to explore different some of the data sets that fall within our domain by filtering on public websites
or by following a geneal google search. This basic query and very general exploration is not enough, we need more. The next step in our process involves visualizing the data in an
attempt to understand trends and themes in our data. It can be very difficult to understand trends in the data without graphing it.

### What graphing tools are available?
There are a ton. If we were not data scientists and instead attempting to move into data analytics, tableu would be enough for us to visualize the data but we need more. We want to 
view trends and understand certain days when no data at all was collected. In oreder for us to do that we are going to explore a few libraries.

+ matplotlib
+ ggplot
+ seaborn

Lets start to visualize our data.
