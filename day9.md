# Thursday week 2

What is anaconda?
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is a a package manager for data science. Anaconda is used to host the Jupyter notebook, the spyder code editor and
other useful tools for data scientists.

What is a package?
In software a [package](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4360/software-package) is a software program bundled together and sold as a set. Usually all of the software
in the package is related in some way and the developer bundled the software together so that the end user can pull a set of utilities out of it.

What is colab and why do we need it?
[Co-lab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) is a hosted jupyter notebook environment where you have access to free GPU and a virtual python environment.

When do we need to refer to documentation?
As we are working through problem solving we may get to a point where the information we have is not leading us to a direct solution to the problem we have at hand. When
this is the case we can start to debug our problem by looking at documentation. Documentation will tell us the way that something is supposed to work and we can do a sanity 
check to make sure that it is actually working the way that it is said to work. We start with our assumption. What is it that we believe the software is supposed to do and how is it currently performing?
If we look at the documentation and uncover the package or software does not actually contain the functionality that we believe it should than it is on us to re-evaluate the way that
the software is being used in the first place.

How do we put our CSV data into a dataframe?
We can use the pandas library to move our data from a CSV file into a dataframe. There is only one command needed to do so, but we do need to know what that command is.
